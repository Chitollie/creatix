# DIY UGC Platform (prototype)

Backend prototype with authentication, uploads, games, assets, simple chat and economy stubs.

Quick start

```bash
npm install
node server.js
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

Notes
- This is a minimal prototype. For production you need proper payment integration, moderation, CDN for assets, file validation, rate limiting, secure secrets, and scalable storage.
